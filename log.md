# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started the JavaScript 30 course and finished Day 1. Built a drum kit plays a specific sound depending on the key pressed.
Worked on FreeCodeCamp's Basic JavaScript section and completed 10 challenges.
Did a few coding challenges on Exercism.io


**Thoughts:** The coding challenges took me some time to wrap my mind around the problem. The FreeCodeCamp stuff was easy although while reading in depth about Prototype properties and attributes I realized how much I don't know.

### Day 2: March 17, 2019

**Today's Progres**: Finished another FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Project. Worked on Day 2 of JavaScript 30 course.

**Thoughts**: The freecodecamp project didn't seem hard at the first glance though I had to brush up the CSS tricks to get all the layout aligned. I need more practice in CSS, perhaps I should try to master CSS flexbox and grid first. Overall I don't think I was that productive today. May be that's the whole point of learning: the more you get stuck, the more you learn.

### Day 3: March 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Redid the FreeCodeCamp Survey Form Project using Flexbox only. Spent most of yesterday and coding along with Flexbox courses and reading the documentation. 

**Thoughts**: The Imposter's syndrome is already kicking in whenever I end up finishing less than I expected. It'll be good if I can strike a balance between learning deeply about a concept and moving on when it's needed.
