# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started the JavaScript 30 course and finished Day 1. Built a drum kit plays a specific sound depending on the key pressed.
Worked on FreeCodeCamp's Basic JavaScript section and completed 10 challenges.
Did a few coding challenges on Exercism.io


**Thoughts:** The coding challenges took me some time to wrap my mind around the problem. The FreeCodeCamp stuff was easy although while reading in depth about Prototype properties and attributes I realized how much I don't know.
